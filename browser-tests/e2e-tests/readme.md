# E2E Playwright BDD Tests

This directory contains the **End-to-End (E2E) test suite** for the **IPV Core Front** application, built using **[playwright-bdd](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd)**, **Playwright**, and **TypeScript**. Tests are written as **Gherkin feature files** with step definitions, following a **Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)** approach to simulate full user journeys across multiple services and stubs.

> 📘 See also: [`browser-tests/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`](../QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for a handy cheat-sheet of common commands and patterns.

## 📁 Project Structure

The framework is structured using the **Page Object Model (POM)**, **Gherkin feature files**, and custom **fixtures** to ensure tests are readable, scalable, and easy to maintain.

### 🔄 How BDD Tests Work

1. **Feature files** (`features/*.feature`) describe scenarios in Gherkin syntax (Given/When/Then).
2. **Step definitions** (`steps/*.steps.ts`) implement each Gherkin step using Playwright actions.
3. **Fixtures** (`fixtures/bdd-fixtures.ts`) inject page objects into steps via `playwright-bdd`.
4. **`playwright-bdd`** auto-generates Playwright spec files into `.features-gen/` at build time.
5. **Playwright** then runs the generated specs as normal tests.

## ⚙️ Local Configuration

To run the tests locally, you need to create a `.env` file in the root of the `browser-tests/` directory. This file stores environment-specific URLs and API keys, keeping them separate from the codebase.

### Steps:

1. Copy the `.env.template` file and re-name it to `.env` in the `browser-tests/e2e-tests` directory.
2. Fill out the necessary config

## 🚀 Running Tests

Make sure all dependencies are installed first:

```bash
cd browser-tests
npm install
```

> ⚠️ Run `npm install` from the `browser-tests/` directory — that's where the `package.json` lives. All test commands below should also be run from `browser-tests/`.

### ▶️ Run All E2E BDD Tests

This generates the Playwright specs from the Gherkin feature files and then executes them:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Under the hood this runs:

```bash
npx playwright-bdd --config playwright-bdd.config.ts test && npx playwright test --config playwright-bdd.config.ts
```

### 🎯 Run a Specific Feature File

First generate the specs, then target the generated file by feature name:

```bash
# Generate specs from feature files
npx playwright-bdd --config playwright-bdd.config.ts test

# Run a specific feature (use grep to match the feature/scenario name)
npx playwright test --config playwright-bdd.config.ts --grep "e2e-passport"
```

### 🖥️ Run in Headed Mode (See the Browser)

```bash
npx playwright-bdd --config playwright-bdd.config.ts test
npx playwright test --config playwright-bdd.config.ts --headed
```

### 🐛 Run in UI Mode (Recommended for Debugging)

Playwright's interactive UI mode lets you step through tests, inspect the DOM, and view traces:

```bash
npx playwright-bdd --config playwright-bdd.config.ts test
npx playwright test --config playwright-bdd.config.ts --ui
```

### 🤖 Run All Tests (Functional + E2E)

This runs both the functional/snapshot tests and the E2E BDD tests:

```bash
npm run test:all
```

### 📸 Update Snapshots (Functional Tests Only)

```bash
npm run update-snapshots
```

## 📝 Writing New Tests

1. **Create a feature file** in `features/` using Gherkin syntax:

   ```gherkin
   Feature: My new journey

     Scenario: User completes the journey
       Given the user starts on the orchestrator stub
       When they complete the identity check
       Then they should see the success page
   ```

2. **Add step definitions** in `steps/my-feature.steps.ts`, importing fixtures from `fixtures/bdd-fixtures.ts`.

3. **Create page objects** in `pages/` if new pages are involved, following the existing POM pattern.

4. **Run the tests** — `playwright-bdd` will auto-generate the Playwright specs from your feature files.
